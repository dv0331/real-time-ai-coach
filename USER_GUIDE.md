## 🎭 Emotional Analysis

The AI reads your emotions through three channels:

### 1. Voice Emotion 🎙️

Analyzes your vocal tone for:
- Happiness/Joy
- Sadness
- Anger
- Fear
- Neutral

The **Arousal** meter shows emotional intensity in your voice.

### 2. Facial Expression 👤

Reads your face for:
- Basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.)
- Micro-expressions
- Genuine vs. performed emotion

The **Expressiveness** meter shows how animated your face is.

### 3. Script Intent 📝

Analyzes your spoken words for:
- Sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
- Emotional keywords
- Tone consistency

### Intensity Meter ⚡

Shows your overall emotional output:
- **Minimal** - Very subdued (good for intimate scenes)
- **Low** - Understated emotion
- **Moderate** - Natural range
- **High** - Strong emotional output (good for intense scenes)

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Camera Setup

1. **Lighting**
   - Face a window or light source
   - Avoid backlighting
   - Soft, even lighting is best

2. **Framing**
   - Eyes at upper third of frame
   - Leave headroom (not too much)
   - Medium close-up is standard

3. **Background**
   - Neutral, uncluttered
   - Solid color preferred
   - No distracting movements

### Audio

1. **Environment**
   - Quiet room
   - No echo (soft furnishings help)
   - Close doors/windows

2. **Microphone**
   - Built-in webcam mic is fine
   - External mic is better
   - Keep consistent distance

### Performance

1. **Eye Contact**
   - Look at the camera lens, not the screen
   - Imagine it's your scene partner
   - Brief breaks are natural

2. **Pace**
   - Nervous? You're probably rushing
   - Breathe between thoughts
   - Pauses add power

3. **Energy**
   - Project slightly more than feels natural
   - Camera flattens energy by ~20%
   - Be expressive with face and voice

4. **Consistency**
   - Warm up before recording
   - Do multiple takes
   - Compare and learn
